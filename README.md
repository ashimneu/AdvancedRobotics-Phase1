# Project Phase1
First phase of EE 245 Advanced Robotics project. The goal is to derive and implement stabilizing controllers for the 2d and 3d quadrotor models to achieve 
hover vertical position control.

## Tasks
-[] Derive 2d quadrotor dynamics and stabilizing controller
-[] Propagate dynamics in Python
-[] Plot trajectory
-[] Wrap in ROS
  - [] Confirm ROS interfaces for CrazyFly (topics,messages, services, etc.)
