# Project Phase1
First phase of EE 245 Advanced Robotics project. The goal is to derive and implement stabilizing controllers for the 2d and 3d quadrotor models to achieve vertical position hover control.

## Tasks
- [x] Derive 2d quadrotor dynamics and stabilizing controller
  - [x] Write 2d EOM
- [x] Propagate dynamics in Python
    - assume test inputs $u_1, u_2$ 
- [] Find stabilizing linear feedback controller
    - apply on $u_1,u_2$
    - solve for $F_1,F_2,F_3,F_4$
- [] Plot trajectory
- [] Wrap in ROS
  - [] Confirm ROS interfaces for CrazyFly (topics,messages, services, etc.)
